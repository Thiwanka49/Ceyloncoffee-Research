### *AI POWERED COFFEE QUALITY GRADING & EXPORT ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM FOR SRI LANKA*

This project presents an integrated, intelligent decision support system designed to modernize and optimize the coffee value chain, with a specific focus on Sri Lankan coffee production and export markets. The system combines artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data driven forecasting to address challenges faced by coffee farmers, exporters, logistics managers, and policymakers. By covering the entire lifecycle of coffee production from plant health and yield estimation to price forecasting, labor planning, and transportation optimization the project aims to improve productivity, reduce losses, and increase global competitiveness.

The first major component of the project focuses on Coffee Plant Disease Detection and Production Estimation. Using image based classification models, the system can automatically identify common coffee plant diseases such as Leaf Rust and Cercospora Leaf Spot from images of leaves and beans. Early detection enables farmers to take timely preventive action, minimizing crop damage and financial loss. Alongside disease detection, a yield prediction model estimates coffee production in kilograms per plant or plot, even under disease stress. This component is designed to scale from individual plants to entire plantations and can be integrated into agricultural advisory platforms, providing actionable insights for better farm level decision making.

The second component addresses Coffee Price and Demand Prediction at both domestic and global levels. By analyzing macroeconomic indicators, weather patterns, and market trends, the system forecasts short  and medium term coffee prices and demand. This allows exporters, traders, and policymakers to plan production, storage, and sales strategies more effectively. An AI-based advisory module translates complex predictions into practical recommendations, helping stakeholders respond proactively to market volatility. Despite challenges such as data availability and unpredictable global events, this component strengthens strategic planning and risk management across the coffee industry.

The third component focuses on Predictive Resource Allocation for Labor and Transportation. This module forecasts the number of workers required for harvesting, picking, and loading on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly bases. It also predicts transportation needs for moving coffee beans from farms to processing factories in both short term and medium-term horizons. By considering harvest size, weather conditions, road quality, and vehicle availability, the system minimizes inefficiencies, reduces costs, and prevents delays. A scheduling and optimization dashboard provides managers with real-time visibility into workforce plans, transport requirements, cost estimates, and alerts for resource shortages.

The fourth component focuses on automated coffee bean quality assessment using image-based deep learning models. It is designed to classify coffee beans into Arabica and Robusta types and to identify quality conditions such as Good, Broken, and Severe Defect from single images captured under real-world conditions. The system uses convolutional neural networks trained on locally collected Sri Lankan coffee bean datasets. The models support confidence-based predictions to reduce misclassification in uncertain cases, ensuring reliable quality evaluation during sorting, packaging, and export preparation. This module helps improve consistency in grading, reduce manual inspection effort, and support higher quality standards in the coffee export process.
